# MARK MORPH - WiFi Advertising Platform Development Brief

## Project Overview
MARK MORPH is a captive portal WiFi advertising platform that monetizes free WiFi access by displaying targeted advertisements to users while simultaneously helping businesses collect valuable customer data, drive Google reviews, and build their marketing database.

## Core Concept
Transform free WiFi from a basic amenity into a powerful marketing and revenue generation tool by creating an intelligent advertising ecosystem that benefits three key stakeholders: end users (getting free WiFi), business owners (getting customer data and reviews), and the platform (generating ad revenue).

---

## System Architecture - Three User Types

### 1. END USER FLOW (WiFi Seekers)

#### User Journey
1. User attempts to connect to free WiFi at a partnered business location
2. Upon connection, user is automatically redirected to the business profile splash page (captive portal)
3. Before WiFi access is granted, user sees:
   - Business branding and identity
   - **Multiple advertising formats displayed simultaneously:**
     - Auto-rotating carousel banners (3-5 second intervals)
     - Video advertisements (skippable after 5 seconds)
     - Static image ads in strategic positions
     - Sponsored content cards
   - Two primary call-to-action buttons prominently displayed:
     - "Connect to WiFi" button
     - "Leave Google Review" button (optional but incentivized)
4. User interaction options:
   - Can browse ads while waiting for connection
   - Option to leave Google review for faster/premium WiFi access
   - Social login options (Facebook, Google, Instagram) for single-click access
   - Email verification for mailing list building
5. After authentication/interaction, WiFi access is granted

#### UX/UI Requirements for End User Page
**Critical Design Principles:**
- **Mobile-first responsive design** (95% of users connect via smartphones)
- **Fast loading times** (under 2 seconds) - users abandon slow portals
- **Minimal friction** - maximum 2 clicks to connect
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with business branding at top
- **Non-intrusive ad placement** that doesn't frustrate users
- **Progress indicators** showing connection status
- **Touch-optimized buttons** (minimum 44x44px tap targets)

**Layout Strategy:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   BUSINESS LOGO & NAME      │
│   (Branded Header)          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│                             │
│   PRIMARY AD CAROUSEL       │
│   (Auto-rotating banners)   │
│   ○ ● ○ ○ (indicators)      │
│                             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  [CONNECT TO WIFI] Button   │
│  (Primary CTA - Prominent)  │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ [LEAVE GOOGLE REVIEW] Btn   │
│ (Secondary CTA - Slightly   │
│  smaller but visible)       │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│                             │
│   SIDEBAR/BOTTOM ADS:       │
│   - Video ad unit           │
│   - Static banner ads       │
│   - Sponsored content       │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Ad Display Specifications:**

- **Static Banners**: Fixed positions (top, sidebar, bottom)
- **Ad Density Balance**: Maximum ad coverage 40-50% of viewport to maintain good UX
- **Loading Priority**: Load connection button first, then ads progressively

**Authentication Methods (Give users options):**
- Social media login (one-click via Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- Email + SMS verification
- Simple email capture with checkbox consent
- Voucher/token codes (for paid or special access)
- Direct connect (for returning users with device recognition)

**Data Collection Strategy:**
- Progressive profiling (don't ask for everything at once)
